## Objectives

Design an automatic car license plate reader and implement using the learnt image processing techniques using C++ and OpenCV to capture the plate content correctly from the 3 provided test input images. The sub-tasks include:

a) Segment each license plate out of an image.

b) Extract out and recognize the characters from each segmented plate.

c) The operation should run in real time and take less than 10 seconds on any of the lab machines for each image.
